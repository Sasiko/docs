# Primary Anti-phishing

## Main phishing database

This bot uses 2 main APIs that maintain a large database of phishing domains that specifically target discord, steam and epic websites. \

Discord is being plagued with compromised accounts that spams phishing links that pretends to be discord, steam or epic in order to trick users entering their login details. Which is the main function of this bot uses these apis to detect and sanction the users accordingly. \
