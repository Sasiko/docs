# Domain Blacklist

## How blacklist works

Server owners are able to blacklist any type of domain at their choosing. Please note that if you ban a domain, you will ban all subdomains aswell.&#x20;

Example. If you blacklist google.com. Then abc.google.com will also be detected and sanction users accordingly.

## Default: <mark style="color:green;">Enabled</mark>

Bot will by default delete message and ban users from all servers if the user post a blacklisted link from server owners blacklist.

**Default punishment type**: Delete & Ban
